    Why? Because we need to evaluate derivatives of the solution with respect
    to the inputs! This is a PINN, afterall. This means that we need torch to
    build a computa1tional graph.

    Should we worry about the computational graph getting stuck in limbo/not
    being cleaned up (we don't call backward in here, which is usually what
    fees it)? No! Pytorch will construct a graph for the losses. However,
    once this function retuns, the losses are destroyed (they're automatic
    variables), along with their graphs.

    # building enabled b/c we have to evaluate derivatives to compute the

    # That's what happens in the training loop. Here, we don't use backward.
    # The graphs will be freed, however. This function builds up graphs for
    # Coloc_Loss and Bound_Loss. When this function returns, however, both
    # variables are freed (along with their graphs!). These graphs do not get
